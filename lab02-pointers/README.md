## Unit Testing
- 280's Framework
~~~cpp
#include "unit_test_framework.h"

TEST(whatever_test_name_is){
	bool potato = true;
	ASSERT_EQUAL(potato, true); // Must use one of the defined assert macros
}

TEST_MAIN(); // Macro that replaces your main, just put it in here
~~~
- This is not how testing works everywhere but is an example of how a company could
- DO NOT REPLACE ASSERTS IN IMPLEMENTATION FILES
